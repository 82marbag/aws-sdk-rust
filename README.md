# The new AWS SDK for Rust 

## About

This repo contains the new AWS SDK for Rust and its public roadmap

**Please Note: The SDK is currently released as an alpha and is intended strictly for feedback purposes only. Do not use this SDK for production workloads.**

The AWS Rust SDK is 100% code generated from Smithy models that represent each underlying AWS service. To view the code gen machinery, navigate to Smithy-RS repo: https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs. 

Because all of the code on this repo has been code generated, **please do not submit PRs to this repo**. If you would like to make a contribution to the SDK, please submit a PR to the code gen machinery on the Smithy-RS repo.
